# battleship
This is a simple single play battleship game.

The user can define the size of the board, number of ships and their min-max sizes. 

Things to implement: 

A restart button. I want the user to be able to play again without having to restart the program.
A score tracking system, i want the user to be able to track their score across mutliple game session. Such as their time and how many shots it took them to beat it. Might need to seperate this into pre defined categories. Right now the user can define a board and ship number as big as they desire so it is useless to have tracking of games that completelyy different.
